What is TC39?

>TC39 means Technical Committee number 39. It is part of ECMA, the institution which standardizes the JavaScript language under the “ECMAScript” specification. It works on the standardization of the general purpose, cross platform, vendor-neutral programming language that is ECMAScript. This includes the language syntax, semantics, libraries, and complementary technologies that support the language.

As a way of explaining TC39, let's answer some of the frequently asked questions.

Q: What exactly is Ecma??

Ecma International is the organization responsible for standardization of information and communications system.

Q: What is the difference between ECMAScript and JavaScript?

A: ECMAScript is a standard of scripting languages, while JavaScript is the implementation of ECMAScript. There are other languages such as ActionScript that implement ECMAScript.


Now that we are clear with the official definition from tc39.es, let's go into the reasons why you, as a frontend software engineer, should be involved.

1. We, as software engineers, should not only be concerned about writing good and functional code. We ought to be involved in evolving standards and keeping an eye out for future trends. 

2. It's a good project to be involved in as it gives us perspective about others think about improving the useability and semantics of JavaScript.

3. It's cool to be involved in something greater than our own personal project.
