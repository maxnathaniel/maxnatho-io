# Why am I writing about TC39?
I woke up one day and thought it's a brilliant idea to read about TC39. 

Well, of course not. It doesn't work that way, for most of us at least.

For me, it was after years of working with JavaScript that I realized I don't want to be just another React/Angular/Vue/ framework developer. I think there are a dime a dozen of such developers in the world. I want to be more. I want to understand how JavaScript works at the core, and why we have specifications such as *arrow functions*, *spread operators*, *destructuring*. We use it on a daily basis but as to why it was implemented the way it was, what the trade-offs are - I believe most of us have little to no idea.

Therefore, instead of just applying the language and seeing it as *magic*, I thought it to be a good idea to look under the hood and understand how the smartest minds behind the language think.

# What is TC39?

> TC39 means Technical Committee number 39. It is part of ECMA, the institution which standardizes the JavaScript language under the “ECMAScript” specification.

It's probably useful to start looking at TC39 by answering some of the frequently asked questions.

# Why should I care about TC39?

* We all want to improve our programming skills and knowledge. Following TC39 will no doubt make you a better JavaScript developer.

* You want to be tuning in to what the smartest people are saying about the JavaScript language whether you're a newbie or seasoned professional. Always be learning.

* If you're a JavaScript developer, and plan to remain one for the foreseeable future, you **SHOULD** be aware of what's going on in the evolution of the language. Well, unless you're happy to continue working in ES5 for the rest of your life.

* Be part of a community shaping the future of JavaScript. What more needs to be said?


# Terminology

**Proposal**: A proposal a suggested addition to ECMAScript. The list of proposals are found [here]
